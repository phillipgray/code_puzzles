## Quickstart Notes
- main interface is through the `Calculator` object
- if you're already in the project folder in the terminal, you can run the code with `irb -r ./calculator.rb`
  - once in the irb session, `Calculator.conditional_sum(upper_sequence_limit_as_integer)` will give you the sum of the even fibonacci sequence elements smaller than the upper limit.
