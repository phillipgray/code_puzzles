## Quickstart Notes
- main interface is through `Calculator` object
- if already in project folder, can run with `irb -r ./calculator.rb`
  - once in irb session, then `Calculator.conditional_sum(upper_sequence_limit_as_integer)` will give you the sum of the even fibonacci sequence elements until the upper limit.
